# Electronic-Medical-Reports
1.This project explores the implementation 
and benefits of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) 
in healthcare settings. It examines the limitations 
of paper-based medical records and the 
advantages of digital EMRs. The project covers 
technical considerations, such as data storage, 
interoperability, security, and privacy, as well as 
different technologies used for EMR creation and 
management. The benefits of EMRs for healthcare 
providers, patients, and researchers are discussed, 
including improved diagnosis, coordinated care, 
patient empowerment, and research insights. 
Challenges such as data security, interoperability, 
user adoption, and ethics are also addressed, along 
with potential strategies for mitigating them. 
Overall, the project highlights the transformative 
potential of EMRs in enhancing healthcare delivery 
and calls for collaboration among stakeholders to 
ensure successful implementation.

Uses SQL as data base and Java Swings for the Frontend.

2. ARCHITECTURE
2.1. JAVA SWINGS 
Java swing tutorial is a part of Java 
Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to 
create window-based applications. It is built 
on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing 
Toolkit) API and entirely written in java. Java 
swing provides platform independent and 
lightweight components. The javax.swing 
package provides classes for Java swing API 
such as Jbutton, JTextField, JTextArea, 
JCheckbox, JOptionPane etc. which we have 
used to perform various functions in our 
project.
2.2. SQL 
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a 
database query language used for storing 
and managing data in Relational DBMS. SQL 
was the first commercial language 
introduced for E.F Codd's Relational model 
of database. Today almost all RDBMS 
(MySQL, Oracle, Infomix, Sybase, MS Access) 
use SQL as the standard database query 
language. SQL is used to perform all types of 
data operations in RDBMS. We have used 
Oracle database to implement our project.
